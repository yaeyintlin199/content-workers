## Installation

```bash
npm install @content-workers/plugin-resend
```

## Setup

To use the Resend plugin, you need to add it to your Lucid CMS config file. You'll need to provide the from email configuration and your Resend API key.

```typescript
import { nodeAdapter, defineConfig } from "@content-workers/node-adapter";
import LucidResend from "@content-workers/plugin-resend";

export const adapter = nodeAdapter();

export default defineConfig((env) => ({
    // ...other config
    plugins: [
        LucidResend({
            apiKey: env.RESEND_API_KEY,
        }),
    ],
}));
```

## Configuration

This plugin offers the following configuration options to control email sending behavior.

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `apiKey` | `string` | Your Resend API key |
| `webhook` | `object` | Configure the Resend webhook |

### apiKey

Your Resend API key, which you can obtain from your Resend dashboard. It's recommended to store this as an environment variable for security.

### webhook

The `webhook` object contains the options needed to enable the webhook endpoint. This is used so that Resend can send delivery status updates back to Lucid CMS allowing you to see it on the emails page instead of having to navigate to Resends own dashboard.

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `boolean` | Determines if the webhook route should be registered or not |
| `secret` | `string` | Your webhooks signing secret |

This listens to the following event types:

- email.bounced
- email.clicked
- email.complained
- email.delivered
- email.delivery_delayed
- email.failed
- email.opened
- email.scheduled
- email.sent

The webhook route is registered at `/api/v1/resend/webhook`.
